        <h2>Pancakes</h2>
        <p>Pancakes are a classic breakfast dish enjoyed worldwide for their simplicity and deliciousness. Typically made from a batter consisting of flour, milk, and eggs, these thin, flat, and circular delights are cooked on a griddle or in a pan.

Pancakes are known for their versatility, allowing for various toppings and accompaniments. Common choices include butter, syrup, fresh fruits, whipped cream, or even savory options like bacon or sausage.</p>
        <p>The texture of pancakes is a delightful combination of softness and fluffiness, creating a satisfying mouthfeel. Recipes may vary, with some incorporating additional ingredients like baking powder for extra lift or flavorings such as vanilla or cinnamon. Whether enjoyed as a traditional stack for breakfast or as a creative canvas for culinary experimentation, pancakes hold a special place in the hearts and palates of those seeking a comforting and delightful start to their day.</p>
